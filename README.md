Programming Tool Kit - Schema Tool
==========

This projct is part of [my][1] personal toolkit. Since I'm really just getting started
with this set of tools, this is my first. The `schema` tool is a framework-agnostic and
db-agnostic way of managing and versioning your schema. There are a lot of great
schema-management tools out there, but they are either tied to a particular framework,
written in a set of languages that make it difficult to install for most people, or
are tied to a particular database or set of databases.

The aim of the `schema` tool is to provide one binary (for all platforms) that can be
easily installed and used with a variety of databses (any database that has a schema).
The tool also aims to offer a set of useful features for versioning your schemas, 
tracking changes in your database, and aiding with development within a large team.
